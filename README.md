# 🧠 Introduction

A line follower robot is an autonomous robot that follows a predefined path marked using a black line on a white surface.

The robot uses:
- IR sensors to detect the line
- Arduino UNO for decision making
- L298N motor driver for motor control

Based on sensor outputs, the Arduino controls motor direction and speed to keep the robot aligned with the path.

# 🔥 Fire Detection and Extinguishing System

The robot is integrated with a fire detection and extinguishing mechanism to improve safety and automation capabilities.

The system uses a **Flame Sensor** to continuously monitor fire conditions while the robot performs line following operations. When fire is detected, the robot automatically stops moving and activates a fan-based extinguishing system.

---

# 🧠 Working Principle

The flame sensor continuously checks for the presence of fire.

When a flame is detected:
- The robot immediately stops
- Fan motor turns ON
- Servo motor rotates to scan the fire direction
- Fire extinguishing process begins

This creates an automatic emergency response system.

---

# 📌 Components Used

| Component | Function |
|-----------|-----------|
| Flame Sensor | Detects fire/flame |
| Servo Motor | Rotates to scan flame direction |
| Fan/Coreless Motor | Extinguishes fire |
| Arduino UNO | Controls the system |

---

# 🔥 Flame Detection Logic

The flame sensor output is continuously monitored using Arduino.

```cpp
int flameValue = digitalRead(FLAME_SENSOR);
```

When fire is detected:

```cpp
if(flameValue == LOW)
```

The Arduino identifies the emergency condition and activates the fire response system.

---

# 🛑 Robot Stop Mechanism

Once fire is detected, the robot immediately stops moving.

```cpp
rotateMotor(0,0);
```

This prevents unnecessary movement near the fire source.

---

# 🌬️ Fan Activation

The fan motor automatically turns ON to extinguish the flame.

```cpp
digitalWrite(FAN_PIN,HIGH);
```

The fan blows air toward the fire source to suppress small flames.

---

# 🌀 Servo Motor Scanning

The servo motor rotates to scan different directions for the flame.

```cpp
fireServo.write(40);
fireServo.write(90);
fireServo.write(140);
```

The servo scans:
- Left direction
- Center direction
- Right direction

This helps identify the approximate flame location.

---

# 🚀 Applications

The fire detection system can be used in:

- Industrial Safety Robots
- Fire Rescue Systems
- Smart Automation
- Hazard Monitoring Systems
- Warehouse Safety Monitoring
- Educational Robotics Projects
